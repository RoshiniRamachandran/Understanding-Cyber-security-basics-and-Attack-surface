 # Understanding-Cyber-security-basics-and-Attack-surface
This repository contains a foundational study on cyber security concepts. It explains the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability), types of attackers, common attack surfaces, and an overview of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. The document also maps daily-used applications to potential attack points and explains how data flows in modern applications to build threat awareness. Real-world examples such as banking and social media applications are used to connect theoretical concepts with practical scenarios.
